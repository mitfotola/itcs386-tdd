# Test list (Part A -- Kitchen Quantity)

# [x] 200 g x 3 = 600 g
# [ ] multiplying a quantity does not modify the original
# [ ] two quantities with the same amount and unit are equal
# [ ] 1 oz is not the same as 1 g
# [ ] 200 g + 300 g = 500 g
# [ ] 200 g + 1 oz, reduced to grams, using a conversion rate
# [ ] (200 g + 1 oz) x 2
